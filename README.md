# vitaSnake
A snake game with smooth rotation made for the PS Vita with LibVita2D.  
Turn left and right to collect as many apples as you can, but avoid biting your tail, or you will lose the game.

# To Do
I have a few more ideas for vitaSnake, most of them will never be made, but what I hope I'll be able to add is touch controls to the options menu and an option for steering the snake with touch.
