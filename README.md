# vitaSnake
A snake game with smooth rotation made for the PS Vita with LibVita2D.  
Turn left and right to collect as many apples as you can, but avoid biting your tail, or you will lose the game.

# To Do
In the next update, I'll try to bring sound to vitaSnake.
After that I'm hoping for a graphic overhaul to make vitaSnake look like a real game.
