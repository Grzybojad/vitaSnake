A snake game with smooth rotation made for the PS Vita with LibVita2D.  
Turn left and right to collect as many apples as you can, but avoid biting your tail, or you will lose the game.

# To Do
In the next version I'll try to add difficulty options with different snake speeds and killer walls on "hard". Each difficulty will have it's own highscore.  
After that I'm hoping for a graphic overhaul to make vitaSnake look like a real game.  
I should also fix the crash that sometimes happens on exit.
